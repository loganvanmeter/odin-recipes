				water in the pot with the candy thermometer. Set on high head and bring
				to a boil. Continue to boil until the simple syrup reaches 240&#176F.
			</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, pour remaining water into the second pot. Whisk in lemon juice, cornstarch, and cream of tartar until there are no clumps. Turn the heat on high and continure whisking until the mixture forms a thick paste that resembles petroleum jelly, again making sure there are no clumps.</li>

			</li>
			<li>Chill dish in the refrigerator for 30-60min until firm.</li>
            <li>
				Turn the Turkish Delight out of the dish, and peel the foil off. Use a sharp knife to cut the candy into 100 tiny squares (10 x 10 grid with each square slightly under 1in in size)
